Add a simple login form via a shortcode and does not add any extraneous code to slow your website. It just uses the core functions of WordPress.

== Description ==

Simple Login SC does just what it means

Simple Login SC does not mess with other plugins because it does just login or logout a user. Nothing more. Nothing less.
It uses the core functions of WordPress thus not slowing down your site. No fancy stuff or hard settings. This is just a login plugin!
	
Using Simple Login SC is absolutely easy

Just type the shortcode where you want a login form to show.
Use [sl_shortcode] shortcode to add a login form to a page, post or in a text/html widget.
You can optionally set the labels for "username", "password", the submit button and/or the welcome message, the logout text. Just by adding text to the shortcode.

Usage

Example: [sl_shortcode username_label="What is your name?" password_label="Password Please!" button_text="Let me in!" welcome_text="Hello" logouttext="Let's go outside!"]

This is very useful if the language pack is not available in your language or if you have a multilangual site running WPML.
If you do not set one or all of the optional text, the default text of WordPress and the plugin will be used.
